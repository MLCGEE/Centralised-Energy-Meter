This folder shows the simulation results using proteuis.

Figure 1 : shows simulation result of proposed energy meter at sufficient balance.
  Relay circuit is ON  and supply is live
  No indications and alarm
  
The figure 2 shows simulation result of proposed energy meter at low balance.
  Relay circuit is ON and supply is live.
  An indication (blue led) is turned on at low balance.
  Buzzer alarm is ON
  
The figure 3 shows simulation result of proposed energy meter at zero balance.
  Relay circuit is OFF and supply is cut off. 
  An indication (red led) is turned on at zero balance.
  Buzzer alarm is ON.
