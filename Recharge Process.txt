The recharging process in the proposed metering system is similar to that of recharging balance in a mobile phone. The user has to buy a scratch card and scratch it to uncover the secret pin number of the corresponding energy unit he has bought. For example, if a user wants to buy 100 units (KWh), he has to pay for the 100 units and obtain a scratch card which holds the secret pin number of the corresponding 100 units. The user has to send the pin number to the server through SMS. The server then checks whether the pin number is valid or not. If the pin number is valid, the server then extracts the information of energy-unit from the pin number (in these case100 units) and sends it to the meter of the user through gprs network. The household meter then receives the corresponding unit and is activated. As the user consumes energy, the corresponding units are deducted from the total balance and the remaining units are displayed using LCD. After the consumption of the allocated energy, the meter automatically disconnects the load from the main power line using the relay until the user recharges again. Thus the system avoids the irregularities associated with traditional billing system and ensures revenue collection.
